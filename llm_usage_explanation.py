‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED:
   ‚Ä¢ LLM processor module with GPT-2 integration
   ‚Ä¢ Fallback system with rule-based extraction
   ‚Ä¢ Prompt templates for structured extraction
   ‚Ä¢ JSON response parsing and validation
   ‚Ä¢ Model availability checking
   ‚Ä¢ Configuration management

‚ùå NOT CURRENTLY USED:
   ‚Ä¢ The current working pipeline uses rule-based extraction only
   ‚Ä¢ LLM integration exists but is not the primary extraction method
   ‚Ä¢ The 'proper_output_formatter.py' uses pure regex patterns
   ‚Ä¢ LLM is available but not actively used in the final output

üéØ WHY RULE-BASED IS PRIMARY:
   ‚Ä¢ More reliable for specific document formats
   ‚Ä¢ Faster processing speed
   ‚Ä¢ No dependency on model availability
   ‚Ä¢ Consistent output format
   ‚Ä¢ Easier to debug and maintain

ü§ñ LLM AS ENHANCEMENT:
   ‚Ä¢ Available for future enhancement
   ‚Ä¢ Can be enabled for complex documents
   ‚Ä¢ Provides fallback for edge cases
   ‚Ä¢ Enables more sophisticated analysis
